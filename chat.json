This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying \"I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file\").\nDo NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\n1. Core Features - What should users be able to do?\r\n- So we think of these features:\r\n    - so there will be a user login/registration first, so each user can have their own identity in using the system\r\n    - Each User has the ability to upload/delete photos, and all users can see all uploaded pictures on the s3 bucket (but with the user's preference of whether the image is public or private)\r\n    - in the uploaded photo, it can have a description set by the user\r\n    - there will be a main feed, like user can browse all photos that is currently publicly available, but there will be no reactions or comments yet\r\n    - hence we try to do the basic functionality first, before we dive deeper\r\n\r\n    2.  Data Architecture - How should we split between RDS and DynamoDB?\r\n    - can you suggest how to use them based on the features i have said above? For context, in our previous activity we used RDS to store logs of all the lambda function. and DynamoDB to store a userID and theme Preference (light/dark) only. however that activity is simple, there is a input of username there and a load preference, and toggle preference. if user doesnt exist, it will create new user on the dynamo db with a default light mode. then if load preference is clicked, then it will load the user preference from the dynamo db, and for example it is light, the system will go light mode. And if toggle preference is pressed, then it will go to like light to dark mode, or dark to light mode.\r\n\r\n 3. Storage Strategy:\r\n - for storage, we will use s3 bucket\r\n\r\n 4. Architecture Approach:\r\n - what is the difference of the option a or b?\r\n\r\n 5. authentication\r\n - i dont know yet aws cognito, but we can try to use it in the future\r\n\r\n 6. Scale and Complexity\r\n - learning project\n</userRequest>\n"

This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying \"I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file\").\nDo NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nwe need option A, EC2 and Lambda. because we are required to use the following: \r\n• EC2: for hosting a basic frontend or server component \r\n• S3: for storing static files or application assets \r\n• MySQL or PostgreSQL RDS: for relational data \r\n• DynamoDB: for NoSQL or key-value data \r\n• API Gateway: to expose serverless endpoints \r\n• Lambda: to handle API logic and interact with RDS, DynamoDB or S3\r\n\r\nlet's set aside first the data split, i am gonna think it later thoroughly, but currently the architecture diagram is good for me.
